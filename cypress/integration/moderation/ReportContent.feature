Feature: Report and Moderate
  As a user
  I would like to report content that violates the community guidlines
  So the moderators can take action on it

  As a moderator
  I would like to see all reported content
  So I can look into it and decide what to do

  Background:
    Given we have the following user accounts:
      | id            | name                                          |
      | u67           | David Irving                                  |
      | annoying-user | I'm gonna mute Moderators and Admins HA HA HA |

    Given we have the following posts in our database:
      | authorId      | id | title                         | content                                              |
      | u67           | p1 | The Truth about the Holocaust | It never existed!                                    |
      | annoying-user | p2 | Fake news                     | This content is demonstratably infactual in some way |
  Scenario Outline: Report a post from various pages
    Given I am logged in with a "user" role
    When I see David Irving's post on the <Page>
    And I click on "Report Post" from the content menu of the post
    And I confirm the reporting dialog because it is a criminal act under German law:
      """
      Do you really want to report the contribution "The Truth about the Holocaust"?
      """
    Then I see a success message:
      """
      Thanks for reporting!
      """
    Examples:
      | Page         |
      | landing page |

    And I see David Irving's post on the post page
    When I click on the author
    And I click on "Report User" from the content menu in the user info box
    And I confirm the reporting dialog because he is a holocaust denier:
      """
